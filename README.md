# PyAnalyzer - A Python Code Quality Analyzer

PyAnalyzer is a Python tool that helps developers maintain high code quality by analyzing their Python code and providing suggestions for improvements. It integrates several popular Python code quality tools such as pylint, pycodestyle, and pyflakes, and provides a unified interface for running these tools and viewing their results.

## Note

PyAnalyzer is a tool to help identify potential issues in your code, but you should not rely solely on this tool to determine the quality of your code. It is important to also manually review your code and ensure that it meets your quality standards. The tool can provide valuable insights and suggestions, but the final decision on code quality should be made by the developer or the development team.

## Features

- **Code Quality Analysis**: PyAnalyzer analyzes Python code for common coding errors, style violations, and code smells. It uses popular Python code quality tools such as pylint, pycodestyle, and pyflakes to provide comprehensive code analysis.
- **Customizable Rules**: PyAnalyzer allows developers to customize the rules used for code analysis. Developers can choose which rules to enable or disable, and can also set custom thresholds for code quality metrics.
- **Command Line Interface**: PyAnalyzer provides a command line interface for running code analysis on Python projects. This makes it easy to integrate PyAnalyzer into continuous integration pipelines.
- **Report Generation**: PyAnalyzer generates detailed reports on code quality issues, including a summary of the issues found, their severity, and suggestions for fixing them. These reports can be exported in various formats such as HTML, XML, and JSON.

## Benefits

- **Improved Code Quality**: PyAnalyzer helps developers maintain high code quality by providing suggestions for improvements and identifying common coding errors and style violations.
- **Increased Productivity**: By integrating with popular IDEs, PyAnalyzer makes it easier for developers to fix code quality issues, reducing the time and effort required to maintain high code quality.
- **Better Collaboration**: PyAnalyzer provides a unified interface for running code quality tools, making it easier for teams to collaborate on code quality issues.
- **Continuous Integration**: PyAnalyzer can be integrated into continuous integration pipelines, ensuring that code quality issues are identified and fixed early in the development process.
- **Customizable**: PyAnalyzer allows developers to customize the rules used for code analysis, making it easy to adapt to different coding standards and project requirements.

## Installation

To use PyAnalyzer, simply download the `pyanalyzer.py` script and run it from the command line:

```
python pyanalyzer.py path/to/your/python/files -o json
```

This will analyze the Python files in the specified path and generate a JSON report. You can also use the `-c` option to specify a custom configuration.
